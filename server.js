/**

Client-Side:

Clients emit events (send-chat-message, new-user) to the server, which is responsible for handling and broadcasting those events to other clients.
Clients also listen for events (chat-message, user-connected, user-disconnected) sent by the server and update their UI accordingly.

Server-Side:

The server listens for events (new-user, send-chat-message, disconnect) from the clients.
When an event is received, the server can choose to emit to all clients (io.emit) or broadcast the message to all clients except the sender (socket.broadcast.emit).

/*

SO
socket.emit behaves differently then io.emit
it also depends on whos calling who.

socket.emit() would emit the message to you but anyone else

io.emit() would emit the message to everyone including you.


socket.broadcast.emit() would emit the message to everyone but you.

theres is no io.broadcast.emit() hahahahah
